      <li id="AI"><b class="heading">AI(Artifcial Intelligence).</b></li>
      <p class="para">
        Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence
        processes by machines, especially computer systems. The AI and Deep
        Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will aid in your
        comprehension of deep learning's potential, difficulties, and effects as
        well as equip you to take part in the creation of cutting-edge AI
        technology.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        We will start this course by understanding the fundamentals and use
        cases for AI and move on to building next-gen intelligent apps using
        OpenAIâ€™s powerful models and Next.js 13.
      </p>

      <li id="WaM"><b class="heading">Web 3 and Metaverse.</b></li>
      <p class="para">
        In this course you will learn how to develop Web 3.0 DApps, create a
        project, deploy it in production, write smart contracts, unit test them,
        and create user interfaces for them. We will also learn to develop
        ERC-20 and NFT tokens, DAOs, Oracles, etc. Please note that in order to
        develop Web 3 applications you also need to build on top of Web 2.0
        technologies which we have already covered in the previous quarters.
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <li id="CNaC"><b class="heading">Cloud-Native and Computing.</b></li>
      <p class="para">
        Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing,
        constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and
        take full advantage of the cloud computing model. Cloud-native
        technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable
        applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private,
        and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable
        infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient,
        manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow
        engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with
        minimal toil.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment,
        scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this course,
        you will learn how to develop cloud applications using cloud-native
        technologies like Containers, Kubernetes, and CDK for Kubernetes.
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      <li id="ACaI"><b class="heading">Ambient Computing and IoT</b></li>
      <p class="para">
        Ambient computing, also commonly referred to as ubiquitous computing, is
        the concept of blending computing power into our everyday lives in a way
        that is embedded into our surroundings - invisible but useful. In a
        multi-device world, people don't want to spend their life fussing with
        technology. An ambient approach gets the tech out of your way so you can
        live your life while getting the help you need. It doesn't matter what
        device you're using, what context you're in, whether you're talking,
        typing, or tapping. The technology in your life works together
        seamlessly. Ambient computing uses all aspects of modern-day technology,
        including voice assistants, artificial intelligence, sensors,
        connectivity, cloud computing and more.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        If you were thinking that the IoT and ambient computing sound a lot
        alike, you aren't wrong; the two concepts are intertwined. IoT refers to
        the vast array of devices that connect to the internet to optimize their
        functionality, like smart sensors and smart speakers: ambient computing
        builds on that. Ambient computing focuses on the interaction between
        these devices once they are connected.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Matter, the next-generation smart home standard, solves many smart home
        pain points while bringing all our IoT devices together. Some of the
        biggest tech companies are working together to make Matter a unified
        protocol for future smart homes. These companies include Apple, Amazon,
        and Google. This means Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings,
        Google Nest, and Samsung SmartThings will support the Matter standard by
        default for all new devices.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        In this course we will learn to build smart homes with Amazon Alexa and
        Matter protocol.

      <li id="GaB"><b class="heading">Genomics and Bioinformative.</b></li>
      <p class="para">
        This course will focus on learning the basics of the Python programming
        language through genomics examples.
      </p>

        <b class="heading">Network Programmability and Automation.</b>
      </li>
      <p class="para">
        This course will focus on learning the basics of the networking and
        preparing for the new Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam.
        This comprehensive course focuses on the solutions and technologies
        needed to implement and administer a broad range of modern networking
        and IT infrastructure.
